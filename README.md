# Next.js ToDo App

This is a next-generation ToDo application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), leveraging the power of server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Purpose

The Next.js ToDo App is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. With a simple and intuitive interface, it allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, mark them as complete, and filter through their to-do list.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
git clone https://github.com/mlejva/nextjs-todo-app.git
npm install

# Using yarn

yarn install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
