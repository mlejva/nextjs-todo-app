# Next.js Todo App Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture of the Next.js Todo application.

## Overview

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications by providing a standard way to server-render pages.

## Key Components

- **Pages**: In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the `pages` directory. Pages are associated with a route based on their file name.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows API routes to be defined as server-side functions. These are located in the `pages/api` directory, which is mapped to `/api/*`.
- **Static Files**: Public assets such as images, fonts, and static JavaScript are placed in the `public` directory and can be referenced from the root URL.
- **Styling**: Global styles are imported inside `pages/_app.js`, and component-level styles use CSS Modules located in the same directory as the component.
- **Static Generation**: Next.js pre-renders pages at build time by generating static HTML.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Instead of pre-rendering at build time, Next.js generates the required HTML on each request.
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Client-side JavaScript handles page rendering for navigation between routes.
- **Data Fetching**: Next.js supports various data fetching strategies including `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps`.
- **Routing**: Next.js has a built-in routing system that does not require configuration.

## Deployment

Next.js apps can be deployed as server-rendered, statically generated sites, or a hybrid of both, depending on the data fetching strategies used.

## Conclusion

The architecture of a Next.js application provides a mix of server-side and client-side rendering options, coupled with a straightforward routing system and multiple data fetching strategies, to create a seamless development experience for building React applications.
